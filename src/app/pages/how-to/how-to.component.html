        <h2>Questions</h2>
        <p>The game features two types of questions: email and chat.</p>
        <p>Email questions will take the form of an email from a colleague or an attacker in disguise, both detailing a message concerning a cyberattack.<br>
        Chat questions will involve a character asking you a question regarding a cyberdefense practice. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Answering these questions will involve a number of choices that will be present. What choice you will make will have consequences, whether for better or worse.
